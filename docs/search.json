    "text": "Full Title: Retrospective, Multi-center, Comparative Cohort to Demonstrate Safety of REGENETEN for Endoscopic and Open Hip Abductor Repair.\nPurpose: The purpose of this study is to retrospectively collect data to evaluate post-operative pain following partial-/full-thickness hip abductor tendon tear repair with and without REGENETEN (and Bone Anchors). REGENETEN will be evaluated as both a primary treatment for partial-thickness tears and an adjunctive treatment option for partial- and full-thickness tears. Secondary objectives will include the evaluation of patient function and complications following tendon repair.\nStudy Design: Retrospective, multi-center comparative cohort. This study includes a retrospective chart review and a patient questionnaire to evaluate pain, function, and post-operative complications. The study is no greater than minimal risk, as it only includes retrospective chart reviews and a telephone/electronic (through REDCap, see section 12) questionnaire. No study interventions or study visits are required.\nObjectives and Endpoints:\n\nOBJECTIVE 1: To compare post-operative pain when using the Bone Anchors to affix the Collagen Implant vs conventional surgical treatment (defined as hip abductor tendon repair without REGENETEN and Bone Anchors) during repair of partial- and full-thickness tears in hip abductor tendons at final follow-up (minimum 18-months), as assessed by the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). \nENDPOINT 1:  Group average NRS pain score recorded via telephone survey (minimum 18-months elapsed post-operative time) \nOBJECTIVE 2:To compare the post-operative function and complications when using the Bone Anchor to affix the Collagen Implant vs conventional surgical treatment during repair of partial- and full-thickness tears in hip abductor tendons at final follow-up (18-months minimum), as measured by the HOOSGlobal Survey and recorded adverse events/complications. \nENDPOINT 2: Group average HOOSGlobal scores collected via telephone survey and all peri- and post-operative complications collected from the medical record until the final follow-up (minimum 18-months elapsed post-operative time). \nOBJECTIVE 3: To evaluate the independent influence of patient demographics, surgical variables and pre-existing conditions on final pain and function scores. \nENDPOINT 3: Statistical evaluation of patient demographics, at the time of index surgery, influence on pain and function at the final follow-up. \n\nSponsor: Smith & Nephew, Inc."
